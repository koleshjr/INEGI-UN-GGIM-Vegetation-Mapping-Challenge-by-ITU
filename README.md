# INEGI-UN-GGIM-Vegetation-Mapping-Challenge-by-ITU
Can you enhance training data for vegetation mapping?

## BACKGROUND
Natural vegetation as the whole set of plants existing in a place, and with characteristic structure; height, plant distribution and species composition and abundance, which are determined by natural factors, as climate (macro and microclimate), relief, substrate (soil), is the most visible expression of ecosystems. The importance of vegetation for Biodiversity, Carbon capture and storage, soil formation and protection as well as having an important role in the regulation of the water cycle con not be overemphasized. Human activities in the other hand have affected the vegetation in diverse degrees, from barely perceptible to a deep transformation or its complete elimination (mostly by land use changes). Mapping the spatial distribution and condition of the vegetation types is then of great importance. As the National Mapping Agency the INEGI has produced data on this subject, but is characteristics are not enough to fulfill the present, and urgent needs of information now. A new methodology involving processing and analysis including AI tools is being developed but there are some limitations with the training data that need to be solved to effectively produce accurate and pertinent data.

The primary objective of this challenge is to propose and develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can help to clean and improve training data, either identifying outliers (wrong or suspicious labels), or even suggesting a more plausible label in the given test data. The evaluation of these predictions will determine the winner of the challenge. Participants are expected to submit their final model along with its predictions on the test data indicating outlier observations and desirably a suggested label.

Developing a method for generating and updating geospatial data about the distribution and condition of ecosystems: forests (temperate and tropical), grasslands, shrublands, wetlands and others is of the utmost importance for adequately evaluating forest losses, carbon storage and sequestration, hydrological balances in watersheds and basins, soil and biodiversity, and so to improve public policies that more effectively help to protect in some cases the natural vegetation and to make better plans for ecosystem restoration.

A deep neural network model for massive remote sensing and other geospatial data is already available but it is limited by the data training quality: so improving this quality is essential for producing accurate vegetation and other land cover and land use types maps. This is needed to substitute the present method for vegetation, using only manual â€“ visual interpretation techniques.

## EVALUATION
The evaluation metric for this challenge is the Log Loss.
